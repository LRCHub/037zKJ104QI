# Johnny Stimson – Butterflies

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I guess I'm going
through a phase
I'm feeling kinda low
I never leave
the house but I'm not home
Can't tell if I'm awake,
or living in a dream
A caterpillar drifting
down a stream
And I just wanna fly away
But I can't seem
to get my feet up off the ground
Everything is turning
upside down
Maybe we're just butterflies,
butterflies
Going through a chrysalis
(Oh yeah)
Don't you ever wonder why,
wonder why
We've been going through
all this
Maybe there's a cocoon
around the world
And we're all dying
just to break through
'Cause we'll be butterflies,
butterflies
Brand new
La-la-la-la
My consciousness is
just a state of mind
I meditate to metamorphosize
I needed change,
I shifted paradigms
Go to Hawaii,
get a whole new life
'Cause I feel the breeze
just like a second wind
Underneath my wings
and I'm alive again
Seeing everything
through a new lens
Maybe we're just butterflies,
butterflies
Going through a chrysalis
(Oh yeah)
Don't you ever wonder why,
wonder why
We've been going through
all this
Maybe there's a cocoon
around the world
And we're all dying
just to break through
'Cause we'll be butterflies,
butterflies
Brand new
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Going through a chrysalis
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
We won't even remember this
(Oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
Maybe we're just butterflies,
butterflies
Oh, we'll be butterflies
butterflies
Butterflies, butterflies
Brand new
